            <section id="biography">
                <p>I am a Front-End Developer focused on providing consulting and auditing services; particularly on websites and e-commerce solutions. At the same time, I am finishing my studies in physics at the Free University of Berlin. Over the last 3 years I have worked extensively in web development, doing projects that ranged from web auditing, UI/UX design, deploying e-commerce solutions, and building custom websites from scratch. All of this has been as freelancer, as founder of a web agency, and as employee for the IT department of a medium size B2C company. </p>
                <p>This series of three handbooks, that together form a complete technical auditing guide, are the result of the hard work of those years and the effort put into understanding and organizing how the World Web Wide works as a system, and applying said principles into these three short volumes. The necessity to create my own work documentation was the initial reason of existence of the series, and the material of these texts grew naturally from a inside documentation into a more formal and clear reference guide for other people to read. </p>
                <p>I hope this material can help you in your own auditing and development work. If you have any suggestions or you saw any errors, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:contact@jbroldan.dev">contact@jbroldan.dev</a> </p>
